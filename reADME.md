# A MAN WITH A SWORD

"A MAN WITH A SWORD" is a 2D isometric adventure game built with Pygame. Navigate through randomly generated dungeons, battle fierce monsters, and explore a world of block-based procedural maps. This project showcases dynamic character animation, a simple combat system, and a robust rendering engine designed to handle isometric perspectives and occlusion correctly.
